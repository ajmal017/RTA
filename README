 Technology stack

 1. Django/Flask for back-end api
    Python is known for its speed, ease of use and best ecosystem in scientific and machine learning field. It really shines when u use Numpy, Pandas and Pytables for large computational work. I see python a perfect fit in financial world.
    
  2. client-side MVC: Backbone.js and Brunch
     Node and client-side MVC are really popular over the recent years. so i though of giving it a try ( which is excellent till now. ). Brunch is used for automatic compiling coffeescript files and serve them in dev mode.
     
    
  
  
How to Run:
 1. start mongodb
 
 2.
   $] cd js && brunch watch
   $] python manage.py runserver 
 
   $] open http://localhost:3000
